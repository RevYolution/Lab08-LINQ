## Introduction

- Uses quires to sort the data 
- Outputs sorted data to the console

=============================================

### Sorting Outputs
- First all neighborhoods of the file are selected and out put to the console.
- Second any outputs that are empty strings are sorted out. Leaving only valid neighborhood names.
- Third all duplicate neighborhoods are consolidated so that only distinct names are displayed in the console.
- Lastly the previous sorting methods are refactored to chain off one another.
